Fetch logic:  catch not found exceptions in the lib code!


Should fetch be in ds or dsqry?  e.g.

    (ds/fetch ...)
    (dsqry/fetch ...)

In other words, does the client really need to now about query
objects?  All the client really needs to do is provide the parameters
for a query and then say "gimme this".  All the machinery of
constructing a query object, then prepping it, then casting the result
to an interator, etc. can be hidden.
